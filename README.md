# privateGPT
Ask questions to your documents without an internet connection, using the power of LLMs. 100% private, no data leaves your execution environment at any point. You can ingest documents and ask questions without an internet connection!

Built with [LangChain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain), [GPT4All](https://github.com/nomic-ai/gpt4all), [LlamaCpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp), [Chroma](https://www.trychroma.com/) and [SentenceTransformers](https://www.sbert.net/).


This is a test project to validate the feasibility of a fully private solution for question answering using LLMs and Vector embeddings. It is not production ready, and it is not meant to be used in production. The models selection is not optimized for performance, but for privacy; but it is possible to use different models and vectorstores to improve performance.
